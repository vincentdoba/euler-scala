/**
 * === Problem nÂ°28 ===
 *
 * Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
 *
 * 21 22 23 24 25
 * 20  7  8  9 10
 * 19  6  1  2 11
 * 18  5  4  3 12
 * 17 16 15 14 13
 *
 * It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
 *
 * What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
